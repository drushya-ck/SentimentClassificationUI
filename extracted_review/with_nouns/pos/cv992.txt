-here film unexpected scary original caught guard threw loop okay !n't !quite !original !sequel !box !office !hit !species !certainly !smart most films genre are reminiscent cheesy b-horror films 60s even become however learned small-budget horror/sci-fi film sometimes expectations shattered lot criticism has gone film have read far anyway yep reviews makes wonder types films are automatically dismissed gory laughable pieces trash thing !n't well made well acted quite intelligent see most critics now level gore level sexuality film species series !n't !lack !elements much get film yet has basic premise allows get species begins present day seems alternate universe many films especially sci-fi ones create similar timelines realistic change fit film needs species begins arrival american spacecraft excursion landing surface mars patrick ross justin lazard very bright very handsome astronaut patrick son senator ross james cromwell just wants patrick succeed well seem has succeeded landing surface mars first human ever course !n't !first !ever years ago alien species supposedly landed mars destroyed perfect living conditions were able sustain life now course red planet cold rocky life lives visible life patrick spacecraft landing red soil collects samples ground takes puts storage unfortunately samples contains form life gets loose heated ship just prior back earth life form creeps floor inhabits earthlings pass approximately minutes then shrug !nothing n't even remember blame technical malfunction back earth patrick begins have strong urges mate many women possible know original alien wants breed take planet however children are bred are half-human father patrick really alien breed finds eve natasha henstridge eve was cloned dna taken sil original alien however time most alien urges have been either decreased dramatically lie dormant project led laura baker marg helgenberger role species motives seem respectable was involved original alien attack wants learn stop alien come again has story-wise species much stronger predecessor also much stronger say aliens hey love film !n't !tell !was !strong !story surprised most film was incorporation historical facts screenplay search extraterrestrial intelligence course college learned piece rock mars landed poles piece rock contained fossils have been proof life mars later was proven was !not !living !creature !created script uses effectively also manages provide well-balanced plot first man mars something have always dreamed was film turn element useful point movie does quite well characters are smart know !not only character seems little cliched general george dzundza yet remains logical everything does are obvious flaws course mostly technical aspects special effects are only mediocre are just plain bad most part remain believable even noticed homage alien series mothers gave birth alien children also most realistic ones are usually goriest people torn open someone head blown however plot elements also elicit laughs audience menage troi necessary many people dislike species series excuse sex nudity gory violence however tend disagree were alien films alien species ever did come earth sole purpose was destroy !n't !mate !quickly !possible !many !people !possible only gripe scene patrick goes mate grocery store did !n't !realize !aliens !were !picky !women !mate !just !assume !part-human !side !most !beautiful !one acting quite good kind film vast improvement first film least acting key element film was bad have lowered camp was good have asked comparison films aliens okay !n't !good george dzundza probably most obvious mistake casting over-the-top impersonation general makes annoying distracting natasha henstridge limited time usually enclosed cage however does manage very impressive performance aspect talent yeah quite fun just plain watch marg helgenberger immensely better time performance probably best film michael madsen so-so !n't !annoying !soon !becomes !rather !appealing !nice !cynic !personality james has small part makes much better have been more incapable actor say film james cromwell dramatically increases likeability mykelti williamson gives enjoyable performance gives film more down-to-earth feel course justin lazard lazard has far been ridiculed performance think effective sure wooden !n't !character moment touches glass henstridge was extremely well done due couple acting species rated strong sexuality sci-fi violence/gore language definitely rated film young kids !not !see more likely probably have nightmares !never !have !sex !rest !lives hell !n't !even !know sure critically lambasted film turns surprise film year probably !n't !see !film !was !little !got !much !quite !while director peter medak has crafted very suspenseful sometimes very scary movie mediocre series medak has also mastered wonderful jump moments has probably second scariest moment have ever seen film scream still has first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent sure-handed director species exactly films entertaining
