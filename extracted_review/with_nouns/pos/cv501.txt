wild things was cast neve campbell course has been favorite actresses scream films were released here however turns typical role has done head plays gothic pothead closest role was performance craft even was nice girl campbell probably best film shows wide range talent tell long time denise richards also long time limited roles much range here gets express more emotions stiff yet effective performance starship troopers hopefully day land very good role display ability then daphne rubin-vega newcomer movies gives very good performance character mostly left background first hour half end does get bigger part male side matt dillon probably best subtle performance surprises twist kevin bacon has slightly wooden character makes most have admiration though did screen many women reactions theater shot have grown deeper appreciation bacon yeah right then bill murray performance comic relief nearly steals film whole entire cast works wondrously together seem home even menage troi director john mcnaughton has previously done critically acclaimed henry portrait serial killer has constructed wonderfully twisty plot works direction smooth stylish visuals are striking filled rich colors almost realistic actually breathe humidity air however seems more home actors are !n't fly-by shots swampy areas are brilliant photography denise richards pool highlight cinematography gorgeous details !not !often !see !film !watch !just !see !camera !take !pictures then music was probably most obvious thing set perfect mood film hard describe words just see film listen wonderfully composed presented sure stick closing credits mcnaughton has finally put credits good use most comedies use outtakes has included small scenes help explain events say are lame attempts explain convoluted plot entertaining way finish film are shocking moments credits just add fun wild things appropriately rated strong sexuality nudity language violence again nudity rather unnecessary let face people want see !not !give neve campbell admirably has no-nudity clause contract most see behind takes top way neve sex scenes are graphic especially first see mother deck hands almost wonders got away rating language quite harsh too sexual innuendo average everyday profanity !n't !stress !enough n't allow kids see film target age movie range see definitely !not did mention film rated however get chance watch probably more likely pleased even take friends see next time
