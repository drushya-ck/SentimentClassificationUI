-warning spoilers are included review does !n't !really !make !much !difference deep impact begins official summer movie season also brings back memories remember peak came few months later volcano was released first film was smart exhilirating best disaster films had ever seen latter film was incohesive mess defied logic wasted talent well deja again disaster films head head competition time unfortunately first comet flick bad people shy away armageddon comet-disaster released beginning course general reaction audience was oppposed mine minority was stood side peak deep impact began wonder anyone right mind actually like film apparently many did utterly baffles completely honest have !n't !had !little !fun !disaster !film !entire !life volcano had implausibilities wazoo was still rather fun watch deep impact does !n't !just !have !implausibilities !also !contains !cheap !human !drama !incredibly !horrible !special !effects !poorly !constructed !plot only thing gives half star bottom ranking slightly entertaining final minutes good actors most characters deep impact begins unnamed year year varies advanced technology sets future fire sky local movie theater back line

!kill !entire !human !race years dust settle actually take much much longer approximately years understand humans come back surface start rest plot standard disaster film procedures subplot worth jenny father jason maximilian schell have very touching relationship forms impending doom final moment characters heartfelt emotional shame !nothing !else !heartfelt now course know comet does impact surface title alone suggests previews actually show absoltuely tension drawn attempt stop comet know !n't !work director mimi leder came successful tries direction episodes hit television show major film debut was peacemaker pathetic heartless action film well time leder outdid film worse suggestion leder please stay away big screen least action genre much blame placed leder directly pace disastrously off film are given subtitles tell much time has passed goes months weeks hours literally feels lapsed time place real-time boring course leder !n't !blame screenwriters michael tolkin bruce joel rubin have crafted simplistic story only gets worse time starts promising soon turns deadly audience anyway chock full cheesy liners know are have more sex anyone else school stupid characters think were back again only subplots remotely interesting rest are forgettable boring main plot outrageous !n't !figure !film !supposed !action !drama !sci-fi put simply special effects film are hit miss situation right miss hit scenes earth are well done ship majestic comet huge mistake more laughable frightening concept even land comet preposterous enough forgiveable !n't !forgiveable !actually !humans !walk !surface give break course much hyped collision comet earth well far spectacular makes independence day look brilliant water land effective once hits continent effects turn ridiculous cgi water used looks bad heard more laughs audience shrieks fact even recommend film want see bad effects actually get days just think visual effects !n't !improved !comes !film !show !really thing has struck wrong note mimi leder direction also influences actors leder loves show actors faces moments terror reminded action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger succeeds shows faces victims realistic situations leder likes flaunt people fears faces instead sympathetic leder seems more sadist moment has astronaut space enough warrant response audience leder wants farther shows person face space cheapest ways ellicit emotional response audience !not !fooled note leder film only picks pace last minutes comet actually impacts pace does pick very emotional moments are shown then again watch people cry loved ones obvious emotional mostly just big trick rope viewers feeling characters did !n't !work anyway actors much are given leoni bad boys naked truth best film given meatiest role character made stronger leoni presence grow care robert duvall energetic fun watch character turned shreds plot elijah wood also comes rather successfully still has !n't !had !many !good !roles !wood !stick !drama are too talented stuff vanessa redgrave barely acknowledgeable performance only enhanced strong presence screen maximilian schell does provide nice humor morgan freeman has been infinitely better gives most shallow performances date quite remarkable leelee sobieski have been better think just suffered poorly written character special note ron eldard denise crosby eldard good role limited plot crosby special personally was tasha yar star trek next generation was highlights film overall very talented cast virtually wasted deep impact rated pg-13 disaster related elements brief language worst films year omen things come summer worst ever luckily movie hopefully armageddon more successful shame film successfully just !n't !worth !much nearly special effects done illustrious ilm huge shocker score composed oscar-winner james horner titanic one have expected more fun witness experience well !not comet does hit earth almost wish just take film
